			<h3>Our Mission</h3>
			<p class = "topP">Our mission is to simplify the current management systems available to
				teams, through a streamlined and easy to comprehend format. We hope to
				establish a broad range of products directed towards design teams. Through
				our system, team members can be added and removed as the build process
				necessetates. Our system will also allow team members to upload their files
				into a private, shared directory.

			<h3>What We Expect</h3>
			<p>We expect our clients to give us direction as to how they would like our platform to be styled.
				We are willing to do what is necessary to ensure each client is fully satisfied with our product.
				With their direction, we can streamline the interface even more so to include exactly what they need,
				and absolutely nothing they don't.
			</p>
			<p>We can also build a bare-bones template that will enable other developers to build off our platform,
				however the amount of troubleshooting available from us is limited due to changes made to the delivered product.
				For projects in which the clients wish for more involvement during the build process, we do offer co-creation oppurtinities
				that will allow the client's team to assist in the creation of their platform, as well as form an intricate understanding
				of the system that will further their capabilities when it is fully turned over to the client. Should the need arise for
				revisions or modifications, our team will work closely with the client to ensure it is back to serving their needs in
				as little time as possible.
