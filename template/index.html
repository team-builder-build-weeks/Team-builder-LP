												<h2>This is the future of <strong>Site Creation</strong>.<br /> Built
												by creators, for creators!</h2>
											</header>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Lambda_Logo.png" alt="" /></span>
											<h3>Our Mission</h3>
											<p>Our mission is to simplify the current management systems available to 
											teams, through a streamlined and easy to comprehend format. We hope to 
											establish a broad range of products directed towards design teams. Through
											our system, team members can be added and removed as the build process 
											necessetates. Our system will also allow team members to upload their files
											into a private, shared directory.</p>
											<p>We strive to produce the best products on the market, and are coninually
											updating our platform for ease of use and accessability. Our clients can
											expect updates on a regular basis. When updates are available, we will notify
											our clients immediately. 
											</p>
											<p>We are always available to answer any questions or to troubleshoot any
											errors that could potentially occur. At the moment, our program is in its
											first level of beta-testing, so any and all feedback is encouraged. Keep in
											mind this is just a rought base, and will be polished as time progresses. 
											Please refer to our FAQ section for assistance in basic troubleshooting procedures.
											</p>
											<h3>How We Can Help You</h3>
											<p>Using our platform, you'll find managing team-based tasks to be simpler and effective.
												Our platform is very intuitive, with minimal introduction-to-implementation time.
												The simplicty of our system is what makes it unique. It allows the user to see all
												team members and the data they've contributed to the project at a glance. 
											</p>
											<p>Our system will enable an infinite number of users to be added to each product, 
												with the workflow displayed in a clean, effective format. This enables the versaitlity of
												adding and removing contributors as the project progresses through its phases.
											</p>
											<h3>What We Expect</h3>
											<p>We expect our clients to give us direction as to how they would like our platform to be styled.
												We are willing to do what is necessary to ensure each client is fully satisfied with our product.
												With their direction, we can streamline the interface even more so to include exactly what they need,
												and absolutely nothing they don't.
											</p>
											<p>We can also build a bare-bones template that will enable other developers to build off our platform,
												however the amount of troubleshooting available from us is limited due to changes made to the delivered product.
												For projects in which the clients wish for more involvement during the build process, we do offer co-creation oppurtinities
												that will allow the client's team to assist in the creation of their platform, as well as form an intricate understanding
												of the system that will further their capabilities when it is fully turned over to the client. Should the need arise for
												revisions or modifications, our team will work closely with the client to ensure it is back to serving their needs in
												as little time as possible.
